# Git + GitHub As A Platform For Reproducible Research 
## Overview
This repository sets out the skeleton of an organizational structure used for scientific research. It loosely follows what I have used for several of my research projects and I hope it inspires you to conduct your research in an open, reproducible, and honest manner.

The layout of this repository is described below.
