# Hospitals

## National/Statewide Statistics

## County Statistics

* `ca_county_hospital_statistics.csv`: Number of hospitals as well as their working staff, contractors, and students for each county in California. Also notes whether these staff were flu-vaccinated or not, and if masks were required or not. Essentially evaluates preparedness of each county's hospitals. Consult `ca_county_hospital_statistics_datadict.xlsx` for the meaning behind each column value. *County names are given not FIPS codes,
so this table might have to be joined with the FIPS code csv file in the `us` subfolder.*
